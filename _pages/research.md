## Dynamics of Auditory Reflective Attention in Speech-in-noise Processing

Picture this: You’re at a party (or a busy restaurant, or out on the streets in a busy city) and you’re having a conversation with someone. They say something that you think you’ve misheard, because it doesn’t seem to make much sense, but as they continue to talk, it becomes clear what they must have said instead. Has that happened to you before? It certainly has happened to me! And thus, a research question was born.

My doctoral thesis work focuses on untangling the temporal dynamics of what happens to our comprehension of a conversation as it unfolds. Specifically, I am interested in how speech that is initially difficult to comprehend is disambiguated as context builds over the course of a conversation or even a sentence. What is the information that we are storing when we initially hear speech? What are we referring back to when we correct our initial perception? And on what time course is this happening as we process words? Having established that we can indeed benefit from semantically related content presented after a word embedded in noise, I now aim to look at the brain activity underlying this complex behaviour.
