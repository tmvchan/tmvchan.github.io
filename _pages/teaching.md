My work in teaching has primarily been as a teaching assistant in the Department of Psychology at the University of Toronto. I have been a TA for various first- and second-year courses such as Statistics, Learning and Plasticity, and Physiological Psychology. On several occasions I have been able to give guest lectures to students, which I have found to be very rewarding experiences. I have also completed teaching Cognitive Neuroscience as a course instructor for the Department of Psychology. 

I have completed the [Advanced Undergraduate Teaching Program certificate](http://tatp.utoronto.ca/certificate-program/autp-certificate/). Through this program, I learned about structuring courses, lesson planning, and effective teaching strategies. I am also taking [Teaching in Higher Education](https://wdw.utoronto.ca/teaching-higher-education) to continue updating and developing my teaching skills, as well as engaging with current topics in post-secondary education.
