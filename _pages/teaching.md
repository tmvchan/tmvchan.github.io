My work in teaching has primarily been as a teaching assistant in the Department of Psychology at the University of Toronto. I have been a TA for various first- and second-year courses such as Statistics, Learning and Plasticity, and Physiological Psychology. On several occasions I have been able to give guest lectures to students, which I have found to be very rewarding experiences. I have also taught Cognitive Neuroscience as a course instructor for the Department of Psychology on two separate occasions (Winter 2019 and Winter 2020 terms). 

I have completed the [Advanced Undergraduate Teaching Program certificate](http://tatp.utoronto.ca/certificate-program/autp-certificate/). Through this program, I learned about structuring courses, lesson planning, and effective teaching strategies that I continue to employ in my classroom settings. I have also completed [Teaching in Higher Education](https://wdw.utoronto.ca/teaching-higher-education) to continue updating and developing my teaching skills, as well as engaging with current topics in post-secondary education. I have also branched into the scholarship of teaching and learning in a project with Dr. Suzanne Wood on developing and testing the efficacy of [sequential writing assignments](https://teachpsych.org/resources/Documents/otrp/resources/wood20.pdf) in improving students' critical reading skills.
