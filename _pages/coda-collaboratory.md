## Cognitive Operations and Dynamics of Audition (CODA) Collaboratory

After some projects being more successful than anticipated and requiring a couple more hands on deck, the CODA Collaboratory was born! Our current focus is on supporting an internal grant project on the nature and uses of mixed-affect ('bittersweet') music. 

### What does CODA mean?

Consulting ChatGPT on ideas for describing the projects of the lab did render a couple of interesting options, all of which used music-related words as the start of acronyms. However, given that not all research and teaching interests were limited to music, the decision was made to include auditory cognition more generally. Finally, we kept the musical acronyms in the word 'coda', meaning 'end', a word often used to indicate the final sequence on the tail end of a piece of music.

### Why a collaboratory?

Unlike many labs on campus, we don't have any dedicated lab space. This means that we are collaborators meeting together from our own places, working together on various related projects. The idea comes from the increasing scale and resource-intensiveness of research that individual labs could no longer do on their own, with a focus on sharing materials, methods, and data across all participating parties.
